You are free to use these assignments in self study and other courses
(CC-BY-NC 4.0), but please do not publish complete answers online.

- If you are a student on this course, you are allowed to discuss assignments with your friends, but it is not allowed to copy solutions directly from other students or from internet.
- You can copy, e.g., plotting code from the course demos, but really try to solve the actual assignment problems with your own code and explanations.
- Do not share your answers publicly.
- Do not copy answers from the internet or from previous years.
- Use of AI is allowed on the course, but the most of the work needs to by the student, and you need to report whether you used AI and in which way you used them (See [points 5 and 6 in Aalto guidelines for use of AI in teaching](https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/guidance-for-the-use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-teaching-and-learning-at-aalto-university)). We have tested some AI on the course topics and assignments and the output can be copy of existing text without attribution (ie plagiarism), vague or have mistakes, so you need to be careful when using such outputs.
- We compare the answers to the answers from previous years and to the answers from other students this year.
- All suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more about the [Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations Thereof](https://www.aalto.fi/en/applications-instructions-and-guidelines/aalto-university-code-of-academic-integrity-and-handling-violations-thereof).

## Weekly assignments

There are 9 weekly assignments (two of them have two weeks to submit).
Assignments are linked from [the schedule](Aalto2025.html#Schedule_2025)
and can also be found in [this page](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/assignments/assignment_instructions.html).
The deadline days for the assignments are given in [the course
schedule](Aalto2025.html#Schedule_2025).

-   The assignments are weighted as 5%, 5%, 10%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 10% (total 100%)
-   The assignments are introduced on Mondays.
-   The assignments answers are submitted via MyCourses Quiz questions with links in MyCourses.
-   Each assignment has also a Quarto template with some R code, but you don't need to submit any report. Just
    answer the questions in MyCourses Quiz.
-   There are chat channels **#assignment1** etc. you can ask questions
    about the assignments. Other students and TAs can answer these.
    There is no guaranteed response time. These channels are best for
    questions that are likely to have relatively simple answer.
-   There are [TA sessions](#TA_sessions) for getting help. These
    sessions are not obligatory. These sessions are useful if you think
    you need help that requires a bit more discussion. The questions are
    answered during the TA session time (if there are too many
    questions, they may be answered in the chat or next TA session).
-   We highly recommend to submit all assignments Friday before 3pm so
    that you can get TA help before submission. As the course has
    students who work weekdays (e.g. FiTech students), the late
    submission until Sunday night is allowed, but we can't provide
    support during the weekends. Sisu and MyCourses list Firday TA sessions,
    which are not organized unless otherwise announced.
-   Your Quiz answers are autosubmitted by MyCourses at the deadline
    time, also if you have answered only some of the questions.

NOTE: The assignment instructions will be updated during the course, and
individual assignments are not guaranteed to be up to date until Monday
8am of the hand-in period of the corresponding assignment week (See the
deadlines below, e.g. the first assignment is not guaranteed to be up to
date until `r sdate("Assignment opens (08:00)", "Week1")` at 8am).

The assignments are mostly solved using computer (R and Stan). Related
demos for each assignment are available in the course web pages (links
in Materials section). See [TA sessions](#TA_sessions) for getting help.

For those who are self studying or who miss several assignment rounds,
there is a possibility to hand in all assignments once in period III (no
need to ask permission for this as this is automatically granted for
everyone). We still strongly recommend students taking the course to
follow the weekly submission deadlines to more evenly spread the work
during the course.

### Bonus points {#bonus}

In addition to the assignment score, one can get bonus points from course
chat activity (e.g. helping other students and reporting typos in the material) and by answering a time usage questionnaire on the course
page in
[MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=47496). Course
chat activity and the questionnaire are not included in the maximum
assignment score and thus are not required to receive a full 100% score.
	   
## TA sessions

You can get help for the assignments by asking in the course chat from
other students or in weekly TA sessions by asking TAs. The sessions are
voluntary.

-   There are chat channels **#assignment1** etc. you can ask questions
    about the assignments. Other students and TAs can answer these.
    There is no guaranteed response time. These channels are best for
    questions that are likely to have relatively simple answer and thus
    are likely to be answered before the next TA session.
-   There are [TA sessions](#TA_sessions) for getting one-on-one help.
    These sessions are not obligatory. These sessions are useful if you
    think you need help that requires a bit more discussion. The
    questions are answered during the TA session time (if there are two
    many questions, they may be answered in the chat or next TA
    session).

There are two TA sessions each week; please see [the course
schedule](Aalto2025.html#Schedule_2025) for more details on the meeting
times and rooms. In the TA sessions, you can get one-to-one help with your
assignments and project work.

During the TA session you can get help in the following forms:

-   Written communication on *the course chat*: you will chat with a TA
    using the "direct messages" feature on *the course chat*. You can
    also, for example, share code snippets and equations through chat
    direct messages if it helps.
-   Oral communication on Zoom: you will chat with a TA using a video
    conference on Zoom. You can also use, for example, screen sharing on
    Zoom if it helps.
-   Oral communication on campus: you will chat with a TA live in
    computer class room

We will use the channel **#queue** in the course chat to coordinate
everything. We announce there when the TA session starts. Then you can
write your help request there, describing in sufficient detail exactly
what is the problem with which you would need help (see below).

Once a TA is free and your question is the first request in the queue, a
TA will mark it with a check mark reaction. Then the TA will contact you
and help with your problem. Finally, once the problem is solved, the TA
who helped you will delete your request from the queue.

### Getting help on campus

-   Login with Aalto account to Zulip course chat (link in
    [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=47496))
-   Go to the chat channel #queue.
-   Write a help request (see below), starting with the keyword "Live".
-   When it's your turn in queue, TA will send you a direct message on
    Zulip, and you will coninue the discussion live.

If you have follow-up questions later, please put a new
request to the queue.

### Getting help via the course chat

-   Login with Aalto account to Zulip course chat (link in
    [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=47496))
-   Go to the chat channel #queue.
-   Write a help request (see below), starting with the keyword "Chat".
-   A TA will send you a direct message on Zulip.
-   You will discuss through direct messages until your problem is
    solved, and then the TA will close the discussion and delete your
    help request.

Please do not send direct messages to TAs without going through the
above protocol. If you have follow-up questions later, please put a new
request to the queue.

### Getting help via Zoom

-   Follow [these](https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/zoom-quick-guide)
    instructions to install Zoom and to sign in to Zoom.
-   Open Zoom, and make sure your video and audio are configured
    correctly. Create a new Zoom conference call, and copy the meeting
    URL.
-   Go to the Zulip channel #queue.
-   Write a help request (see below), starting with the keyword "Zoom",
    and end it with the Zoom meeting URL.
-   A TA will click on the meeting URL to join the Zoom conference that
    you created.
-   You will get help until your problem is solved, and then the TA will
    close the call and delete your help request.

### What to write in the help request?

Your help request should preferably contain a concise summary of
exactly what kind of help you would need. Ideally, after reading the
help request, a TA should be able to already have an answer for you,
or point to FAQ.

Try to describe what is the problem, what you have tried, what you
already know, and exactly what is the relevant part of the code. Please
highlight the important parts. Here are some fictional examples of good
help requests:

<!--
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chat**: I am not able to get the correct solution to assignment 2 part
c) by using the test data. According to the assignment pdf, the correct
solution is 0.4511238, but I am getting the answer 0.3771946. The code
for my function is:

`EXAMPLE CODE 1`

I thought that I have an error in ..., so I tried changing ... to ...,
but then I got a different wrong answer, 0.4285443. I think the error
may be on line 3 in the code, but I do not know how to fix that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Zoom**: I am trying to install the R package ... on my personal laptop
and I am getting the following error:

`EXAMPLE ERROR`

My operating system is ..., I have version ... of R installed and I am
using RStudio. I tried googling the error but was not able to solve the
issue. Zoom meeting link: <https://aalto.zoom.us/j/XXX>
